# To-do List

## Functions
* Adding todos
* deleting todos
* Saving todo in the local Storage.

## Why?

What I've learned so far, and for people who want to learn about local Storage.

### To store item in your local Storage

localStorage.setItem("Key", "value);

*Key refers to the name that you want it to be saved under in your localStorage, where as value will be the actual item itself.*
*LocalStorage only accepts string as of now, so if you want to input an array into localStorage, you'll have to turn it into a string first.*

<br>
<br>
Ex. 
let arr = [1,2,3];<br>
localStorage.setItem("numbers", JSON.stringify(arr));

<br>
<br>

### JSON.stringify(ele) 
JSON.stringify(arr) turns the array into a string.

### To retrieve item from local Storage

*and to get it out, JSON.parse changes it back into an array.*

let storedArr = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("numbers");

console.log(storedArr) //[1,2,3]
